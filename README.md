A Glossary of terms used across the Q applications

**Actions** — ****the steps or processes involved in executing a task or achieving a goal. For example, in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), an action might refer to a user taking a specific action on a decentralized platform, such as approving tokens to be used in a transaction, or minting a non-fungible token (NFT).

**All Time High (ATH)** — ****the highest price or value that an asset, portfolio, or market has reached at any point in time.

**All Time Low (ATL)** — the lowest price or value that an asset, portfolio, or market has reached at any point in time.

**Annual Percentage Return (APR)** — ****a metric used to measure the annualized gain or loss of an investment over a given period of time, expressed as a percentage. This is different from annual percentage yield (APY), which takes into account the effect of compound interest.

**Annual Percentage Yield (APY)** — ****a metric that shows the effective annual interest rate earned on an investment, taking into account the effects of compounding. APY is typically used to compare the interest rates of different investments, and is calculated by dividing the total interest earned over the course of a year by the initial principal of the investment.

**Approve** — ****a function that allows users to approve tokens to be used in transactions on a decentralized platform. This is typically done by sending a transaction to the relevant smart contract on the blockchain, which then sets an allowance for the approved tokens to be used in transactions.

**Asset** — ****is something of value that can be owned and traded. In the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), assets can include cryptocurrencies or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the blockchain.

**Balance** — ****to the current value of one or more positions in an investment portfolio or trading account. In the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), a user's balance might refer to the value of their cryptocurrency holdings or the value of their NFTs.
